* Find out if Vedic signs are used in other scripts. Some documents (such as
  L2/07-060) mention usage of the Vedic characters in Bengali, Oriya, and
  Kannada, but I couldn't find examples on the web or the document registry.
* Find out the other characters (e.g. Tamil) are used in Grantha and add
  them.
* Add Linear A to the script properties for Aegean numbers U+10107..10124
  (see http://www.unicode.org/review/pri271/feedback.html).
* Find out if Arabic percent sign, decimal separator, and percent sign are
  used in Thaana (either historically or presently).
