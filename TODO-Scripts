* For Unicode 9, make the ScriptExtensions property of U+11FCE and U+11FCF
  {Grantha, Tamil} (see http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14218-grantha-tamil-numeral.pdf).
  1/4 appears to be unified with the letter VA, so it's presumably different
  between Grantha and Tamil. Waiting for Shriramana to get back to me
  regarding other potential fractions shared between Grantha and Tamil.
* Add Tulu-Tigalari to the scx of of U+A8F1 after we encoded Tulu-Tigalari:
  http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15162-devanagari-combining-avagraha-prop.pdf
* Go over L2/15-164 and see if there should be any additions to
  ScriptExtensions.
* Find out if Vedic signs are used in other scripts. Some documents (such as
  L2/07-060) mention usage of the Vedic characters in Bengali, Oriya, and
  Kannada, but I couldn't find examples on the web or the document registry.
* Add Linear A to the script properties for Aegean numbers U+10107..10124
  (see http://www.unicode.org/review/pri271/feedback.html).
* Find out if Arabic percent sign, decimal separator, and percent sign are
  used in Thaana (either historically or presently).
* For Unicode 10, add Masaram Gondi
  (http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15090-masaram-gondi.pdf) and Gunjala Gondi
  (http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15086-gunjala-gondi.pdf) to danda and double
  danda.
