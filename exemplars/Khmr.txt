# Core Spec: "The use of U+17B4 and U+17B5 is discouraged.  These newly
# invented characters do not exist in the Khmer script.  They were intended
# to be used to represent a phonetic difference not expressed by the
# spelling, so as to assist in phonetic sorting.  However, they are
# insufficient for that purpose and should be considered errors in the
# encoding."
